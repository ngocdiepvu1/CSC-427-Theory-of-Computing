    "Regular expressions are a usefull programming skill. In this problem set, you will work with the regular expression library provided by Python. Glance through the [Regular Expression documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) at docs.python.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression package is imported with the 'import re' statement. The import statement used in this way brings in all the names (the functions) in the package, refered to first by the name 're', such as 're.search()'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression itself is written using the special symbols,\n",
    "\n",
    "- the star operator is written with a *.\n",
    "- the union operator is written with a |.\n",
    "- parenthesis can be used to group, so that (0|1)* is any string of 0's and 1's, \n",
    "  while 01* would be any string starting with a 0 followed by any number of 1's.\n",
    "- the ^ matches the beginning of the string and $\\$$ matches the end. \n",
    "- for instance,  the regexp 01 searches for 01 anywhere in the string, \n",
    "  the regexp ^01$\\$$ matches only the 2 character sequence 01.\n",
    "- the regular expression language does not have the character for the empty string.\n",
    "  however the ? operator will help you get around this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression package will turn the regexp into an DFA, so that it can be run on strings. As we now know, it can be a large computation. Therefore the package can compile the the regexp, returning an object of type Pattern, that internal has the DFA to determine whether the string matches the regular expression.\n",
