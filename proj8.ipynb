    "A function f(x) is P-time computable if a Turing Machine M, on input x, places f(x) on its output tape and is guarenteed to halt with the correct answer in $O(|x|^d)$ steps, for some integer $d$.\n",

    "1. The class does not change under all reasonable alterations of the Turing machine model; for instance, multiple tapes, or declaring a RAM model of computation.\n",
    "1. The class is not too small. Many algorithms that we use or wish to use are polynomial.\n",

    "The most basic definition of add is to consider the successor function that adds one to a number. The result of adding b to a would be the application of the successor b times to the number a. This would be an exponential algorithm for addition. This is also called \"counting on one's fingers\" and is only practical for small numbers. \n",

    "#### Multiplication \n",

    "Multiplication of b times a can be defined as adding a to inself b times. This would be an exponential algorithm for multiplication. However, there is an algorithm thbat works in time $O(k^2)$ for $k$ digit inputs. This is the algorithm familiar to everyone that works digit by digit of the multiplicand against the multiplier, then adding the partial products.\n"

    "The book describes the P-time algorithm for determining if an undirected graph is connected. The algorithm on page 185, 3ird edition of Sipser (page 157, 2nd edition), starts out marking any vertex. It sweeps through the edges repeatedly looking for an edge with only one vertex marked, and marks the other vertex of the edge. The algorithm stops when an sweep through the edges marks no new vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "With $m$ edges, assuming it is $O(1)$ time to inspect the edge and its vertices, it is $O(m)$ to sweep through them all. Since each sweep either terminates the algorithm or marks at least one vertex, there are at most $n$ sweeps. The algoirthm is therefore $O(m\\,n)$, which is polynomail in the input size of $m+n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph class takes a list of vertices and edges. The vertex list is a list of strings, each the name of a vertex. The edge list is a list of pairs of strings, each indicating that there is an edge between the two named vertices. The graph is undirected, so the name ('a','b') indicates that vertex a and b are connected, and not any sense of direction in that connection.\n",

This is done by creating a matrix of the equations for the three planes, and bringing the matrix to row eschelon form. Then back substitution is used to calcuate a point of intersection. Along the way it might be discovered that the three equations cannot be simultaneously satisfied (for instance, two of the planes are are parallel and not overlapping).\n",

The second line is updated by the subtraction.\n",
